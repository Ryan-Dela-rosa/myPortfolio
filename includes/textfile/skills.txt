Here are my toolbox for development. 
I primarily use PHP on web development 
and everything alongside with this like HTML, CSS, jQuery, 
Bootstrap. Learning a new framework or language is not a problem, 
in fact Python - Django is my second choice for development, 
building small and medium Web apps, small Game Development.<br /><br />
